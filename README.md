Project group "Error 404" for the 2024 EagleHacks Hackathon event.

## Project Vision & Overview

The vision of this project is to unite those with ideas to those who can help. Many ideas go unrealized because it's unreasonable to expect a person to have *every*. *single* *piece*. of information they need to follow through with a project idea (side note from Brad- I have personal anecdotes of projects sitting half-complete in GitHub repositories because I hit a brick wall of knowledge at the time).

Introducing Azul Connect, a Chrome-based extension that allows users within a community to post about their project ideas and gather a team outside the normal bounds of classmates, friends, etc. It's the hope of this extension that more project ideas can get passed around, which can lead to more creative projects and a greater opportunity for improvement, both for the end users of potentially innovative projects, and learning opportunities for the users in the community who can learn through applied experience on these projects.

## Current Prototype

> Note: This section still needs additions

The current prototype is limited in functionality due to the limited timescale of the proposal design sprint. Currently, it has a proof-of-concept with hard-coded examples of what posts might look like, along with a general approach to styling.

## Future Development & Intended Progression

> Note: This section still needs additions

The grander plan for Azul Connect consists of making a fully-functional extension that could reach out to a database locally-maintained by each individual community, where these projects could be loaded live to the extension through added JavaScript functionality. Additionally, clicking on any of the line items could open a new tab containing extended information about the project like additional context, reports on current progress, links to project resources, and potentially a limited message board to engage with prospective project players.
