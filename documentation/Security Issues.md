# Reporting Security Issues or Vulnerabilities
If you come across a security issue or vulnerability while using the extension, please let us know as soon as possible!
- Follow the same process for reporting bugs ([see here for steps](https://github.com/IntrixTheName/Error404/blob/main/documentation/Reporting%20Bugs.md)).
- Use the orange "security" label.
- Include a date and time stamp in the report.
    - Yes, I know GitHub does that already, just include it.  It helps us understand the extension's history.
- (OPTIONAL) For privacy, email one of us immediately after submitting the report on GitHub.  Include your GitHub username in the email so we know who you are.
    - Our contact information can be found [here](https://github.com/IntrixTheName/Error404/blob/main/documentation/Contact%20Us.md) or by viewing the "[Contact Us.md](https://github.com/IntrixTheName/Error404/blob/main/documentation/Contact%20Us.md)" file in the "[documentation](https://github.com/IntrixTheName/Error404/tree/main/documentation)" folder.

At Error 404, we take security vulnerabilities extremely seriously.  Please let us know *immediately* if you spot something.  No matter how big or small a security flaw can be, it could be extorted and exploited by attackers.  That could cause either us developers or you users, or both.  That's no good!
