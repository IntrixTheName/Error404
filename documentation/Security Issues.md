# Reporting Security Issues or Vulnerabilities
If you come across a security issue or vulnerability while using the extension, please let us know as soon as possible!
- Follow the same process for reporting bugs ([see here for steps](https://github.com/VTIvanovIII/PythonIntegration/blob/main/report_process/Reporting%20Bugs.md)).
- Use the orange "site vulnerability" label.
- Include a date and time stamp in the report.
    - Yes, I know GitHub does that already, just include it.  It helps me understand the site's history.
- For privacy, email me at [vti3@icloud.com](mailto:vti3@icloud.com) immediately after submitting the report on GitHub.  Include your GitHub username in the email so I know who you are.

I take security vulnerabilities extremely seriously.  Please let me know *immediately* if you spot something.
