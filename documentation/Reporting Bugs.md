# Reporting A Bug Or Issue
If you come across a bug or issue while running our extension, you can report it to us by doing the following:
1. In the GitHub repository, click "Issues" on the top menu bar.
2. Once in the "Issues" page, click the green "New issue" button.
3. Add a title to the report and give us a description - preferably long and detailed - of what you ran into.
	1. The description box supports the Markdown language, so you can make it look pretty if you want to!
4. You can click the "Labels" tab on the right side to add a tag for what category you are reporting.  It doesn't have to be a problem with the code; it could be our documentation, maybe you have a question, or whatever you think your request fits.
5. When you're done writing, click the "Submit new issue" button on the bottom of the description box.

Thank you for providing feedback on our work.  It helps us all become better programmers and better software engineers.  :)

> **NOTE:** If you see *actual* bugs such as mosquitos or flies on your screen, those are not a result of our extension and may, in fact, be in your room.  We cannot be held liable for real bugs in your room, but we recommend you exterminate them with **extreme** prejudice.
